Pente - One of my favorite games, now in a beautiful digital format. This is a 2-4 player game. The boardgame is a grid with cool designs on each side. Each player has a set of colored glass beads to play with. There will be soothing music or sound effects which will be optional. Pente is based off of Go, which is one of the oldest games in the world. Unfortunately, Pente isn't very well known, so the purpose of this project is to share my love for the game.

Meal Ready - Let's face it: the cost of groceries is only increasing, and most people can't afford to waste food. Also, most of us don't have a smart fridge to keep track of our groceries and suggest recipes based off of ingredients we have on hand. Meal Ready does some of the work of a smart fridge but without the cost. Meal Ready helps us make educated meal planning decisions based on ingredients we currently have. In addition, Meal Ready can be customized based off of particular diets, keeps an inventory of food we have in our kitchen, provides shopping reminders, suggests Snack Hacks, has a special area to bookmark and store Favorite Recipes, and provides tips for extending the shelf life of various foods. Sometimes a little recipe info and meal planning help is all we need to take the extra step to cook for ourselves and others.

This is a great tool for pet owners and caretakers.


Pantry - A web based storage system where you enter in things that you have in your pantry or staples that you often have in your fridge and it will eventually search through a website like allrecipes to tell you the things you would need to purchase in order to create the recipe. It would give you an option of sweet or savory and randomize a recipe for you, there is also a freezer component for things that you make and put in your freezer where it would alert you to the expiration date when that time approaches and let you know it's time to cook it or chuck it. -->
